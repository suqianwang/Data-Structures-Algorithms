1. (30 pts) Implement a stack ADT using STL vector to support the operations: push(), pop(), top(), empty().

2. (10 pts) Test the operations of the stack class for correctness. What is the running time of each operation? Express
it using the Big-O asymptotic notation.

3. Stack Application
Use the implemented stack class as an auxiliary data structure to compute spans used in the financial analysis, e.g. to get the number of consecutive days when stack was growing.
